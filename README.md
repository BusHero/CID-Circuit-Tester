### CID Circuit Tester
This software was implemented within the discipline ***"Integrated Circuits I"***, as a teaching software tool used in the teaching process at the ***Faculty of Computers, Informatics and Microelectronics*** by students of the ***Applied Electronics, Microelectronics and Nanotechnologies, Biomedical Engineering*** study programs.

The software tool verifies the accuracy of the obtained logic function simplification and the logic circuit design.
The proposed software tool permits real verification of theoretical calculations and intends to simplify the integrated circuit design process.
The designed software tool is extremely beneficial to the students' study process.

### Example of usage:
> [!NOTE]
> To simulate the circuit and verify the correctness of the obtained results, it is recommended to use [Proteus VSM Environment](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation)
